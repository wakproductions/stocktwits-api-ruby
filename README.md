# StockTwits API Interface for Ruby

This is a simple gem for interfacing the StockTwits API. Currently, the only function
it supports is get_user_stream, which returns 30 twits at a time for a given user's stream.

I am open to adding more functionality if there is community interest. Feel free to contribute
with a pull request. Just be sure to add tests.
